# Assignment 3: Branching Strategies & Merge Conflicts

## Objective
This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Flow for managing branches and resolving merge conflicts.

## Description
A basic HTML webpage was created and enhanced using two feature branches:
- feature/update-styling: Responsible for adding simple CSS styling to the webpage.
- feature/add-content: Added new HTML content to the body of the webpage.

Both branches modified the same file (index.html) and were merged into the main branch using GitHub Pull Requests. Merge conflicts were intentionally triggered and resolved manually.

## Conflict Resolution
When merging the second feature branch, a conflict occurred in the h1 tag due to both branches modifying it differently. The conflict was resolved by combining the changes in a meaningful way and committing the updated version to the repository.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Git & GitHub
